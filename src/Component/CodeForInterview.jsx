        <h1>What is CRUD</h1>
        <p>CRUD operations describe the conventions of a user-interface that let users view, search, and modify parts of the database.

        MongoDB documents are modified by connecting to a server, querying the proper documents, and then changing the setting properties before sending the data back to the database to be updated. CRUD is data-oriented, and itâ€™s standardized according to HTTP action verbs.
        
        When it comes to the individual CRUD operations:<span></span>
        
        The Create operation is used to insert new documents in the MongoDB database.
        The Read operation is used to query a document in the database.
        The Update operation is used to modify existing documents in the database.
        The Delete operation is used to remove documents in the database.</p>
        </div>
